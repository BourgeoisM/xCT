<b><u>FAQ</u> – Frequently Asked Questions</b>
<ul><li><i><b>How do I get to xCT+ configuration tool?</b></i></li></ul>
Type “/xct”.  Please remember that there are still a few options in <i>[Game Menu --> Interface --> Floating Combat Text]</i>.  I will eventually move them to the configuration tool.

<ul><li><i><b>Can I get my friend into the beta?</b></i></li></ul>
I want <b>xCT+</b> to be in a ‘closed’ beta, but anyone can request to receive an invite.  Have him or her obtain a username on www.tukui.org and send a private message to Dandruff.  Obviously, you can just give him the beta yourself, but this would prevent me from providing important information with each update.

<ul><li><i><b>I have a Lua error; should I report it?</b></i></li></ul>
All Lua errors should be reported without delay.

<ul><li><i><b>An option does not work as described. What do you want me to do?</b></i></li></ul>
I personally test most options before I release each version.  You can go ahead and make a post on the forum if you feel that it is not a very obvious one (e.g. you don’t allow <b>xCT+</b> to show “immunes” but it does it anyway in certain circumstances).

<ul><li><i><b>I can’t seem to find a feature. Will you be adding it?</b></i></li></ul>
Maybe! Make a post, and I will see what I can do.

<ul><li><i><b>Will this Add-On have localization added?</b></i></li></ul>
Yes. Localization changes the language that <b>xCT+</b> uses depending on your region.  I am not going to worry about it too much, but I have been planning it at some point in the near future.  Please stay tuned if you know multiple languages.

<ul><li><i><b>Does this Add-On employ any code from <b>xCT</b> or <b>xCT+</b> version 2?</b></i></li></ul>
The short answer is no.  It was heavily influenced by <b>xCT</b>, but 99% of the add-on has been rewritten. Only the visual style has been ‘copied.’

<ul><li><i><b>When is xCT+ going to be released?</b></i></li></ul>
I am shooting for November, but I can’t make any promises.
